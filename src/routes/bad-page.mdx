import { MyDiv } from "~/components/MyDiv";


## Code sample

```
<MyDiv>This is MyDiv code sample</MyDiv>
```


## To see the issue

Navigating to this page from index renders no problem.  Even hot reload works fine.  

Specifically take note of the closing tag in the code sample above.

Then open the console and REFRESH on this page to see...

 `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'cloneNode')`

... and closing tag in the code sample is now missing some characters.
